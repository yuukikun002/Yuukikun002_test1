    	<h1>Boil water advisory for specified Athens water customers (06/01/18)</h1>
    	<p>Posted on Jun 1st, 2018 in News</p>

    	<h2>The Town of Athens has issued a boil water advisory for the following areas of its system: Sunny Meadows, Ridgeway Drive, Old Pisgah Road, Sunny Drive, Butternut Drive, Hidden Meadows, and Elm Street.</h2>
		<h2>Possible contamination has been caused by a break in a water line. Consumers are advised not to drink the water without boiling it first.</h2>
        <h2>Bring all water to a boil, let it boil for one minute, and let it cool before using or use bottled water. Boiled or bottled water should be used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, washing dishes, bathing and food preparation until further notice. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water.</h2>
        <h2>The Town of Athens anticipates resolving the problem within three days. An announcement will be made when the problem is resolved.</h2>
