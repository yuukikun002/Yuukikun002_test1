    	<h1>Athens Conducting Online Community Survey</h1>
    	<p>Posted on May 2nd, 2017 in News</p>
    	<br>
    	<h2>The Town of Athens is currently in the process of developing a comprehensive plan.  The purpose of a comprehensive plan is to identify issues and concerns of residents and visitors alike that are affecting the quality of life for those that live and work in Athens. The plan will include a detailed action plan outlining specific steps that town government and other partners can take to address the identified issues and concerns.</h2>
		<h2>The comprehensive plan identifies land use, community/economic development, transportation, housing, and infrastructure issues in Athens. Citizen input is a vital part of this planning process.  Therefore, an online survey has been created to solicit input from the general public.  People living outside of Athens are also encouraged to take the survey. The online survey is designed to take only a few minutes to complete and will help local elected officials identify issues and concerns in the Town of Athens.  This information is vital in helping define the future of Athens.</h2>
        <h2><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AthensComprehensivePlan">The survey can be found online https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/AthensComprehensivePlan.</a></h2>
        <h2>Hard copies of the survey are also available at Athens Town Hall and the Athens Post Office. Completed hard copies can be brought back to Town Hall.  Limit one per person. Please complete the survey by May 31, 2017.</h2>
