    	<h1>Fire Hydrant Testing To Begin May 11</h1>
    	<p>Posted on May 2nd, 2017 in News</p>
    	<br>
    	<h2>In cooperation with the Town of Athens, the Athens Volunteer Fire Department (AVFD) will begin hydrant testing again soon. Below is a tentative schedule, which may change as conditions warrant.</h2>
		<h2>The AVFD wants to advise our residents that sediment in the lines may become stirred up by these tests but every effort is being taken to minimize the effect on residents. These tests are being conducted to insure functionality of the fire hydrants, mapping of all hydrant locations, and to document their flow capabilities. These tests will help our Insurance Services Office rating which translates into lower insurance premiums to the citizens of our jurisdiction. Please be patient with us while we conduct this service for our community.</h2>
